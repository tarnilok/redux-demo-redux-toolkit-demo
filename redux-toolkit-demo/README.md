- REDUX TOOLKIT
- npm init --yes to create package.json
- npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
- slice is a redux toolkit convention and we are not appending it because a slice of cake seems appropriate. the entire application state is split into slices and managed individually
- const createSlice = require('@reduxjs/toolkit').createSlice
- createSlice will automatically generate action creators with the same names as the reducer functions we have written. ordered and restocked. we don't have to type it by hand.
- we don't have to explicitly return new state in toolkit
- we can directly mutate the state in toolkit
- instead of createStore we use configureStore
